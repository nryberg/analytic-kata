It all boils down to two things - how do you know what you're looking at, and how big is it?

Groups are labels - they can be as simple as names - Bob, Fred, Jane, or numbers (111-22-3333 is the most common number pattern.  Groups can't add or multiply but they can be combined or split.  You wouldn't want to do math on a group.  

Measures are numerics that can be added - 3 oranges, 5 cars, 2 dollars.  They can be binned into groups for histograms, but generally speaking you wouldn't label something with a measure number.  Some numbers come for free - the count of records, the number of columns, the length of text.  Others should be totalled - sales, costs, sizes, durations.

Time is the hardest one to categorize becuase it is almost always a label - lets meet at this specific time, the package was delivered at, - but we can always do math on the differences between two times.  Grouping things by days, weeks, months and quarters is an ability that every analytic tool should do natively and easily.  Times, and their first cousin, dates, are typically the most interesting types of data, and each and every analytic tool out there does a slightly different take on the problem.  Times can be particularly gnarly if you're talking about time zones - and the lack or presence thereof.  

Mentally speaking, we want to know the label and the amount.  Everything else is lumpy gravy from this point on. 

A good measure of how good the analytic tool of choice is how simple or complex it is to group and measure data.  The best tools make the interface fun and physical - you drag the measures here and there, you drop the groups and create charts on the fly.  

The picture comes to life in front of you, and suddenly you have handles on what's really (or not) going on.  The worst tools fight you every step of the way, requiring coding, submission to server wait times, and annoying and obscure error messages telling you that you're doing it all wrong anyways.   

As analysts and business partners, your job is to dive deep in the data, come up with some new and handy ways of thinking about the data.  Unless you're doing root cause analysis, your audience _does **not** care_ about how you did it, and what the final numbers really add up to.
