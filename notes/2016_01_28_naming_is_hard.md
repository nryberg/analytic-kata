## Naming your dog is hard
_01/28/16_

But just as critical as what you label data in your analytics.  Labels in analytics come in a couple of flavors:

* In the data - prime grouping material!  These are names given to you gratis - you can use it to gather entries together, find patterns, uncover outliers, and quickly jump to conclusions, good or bad.

* Of the data - column names describe whats listed.  Sometimes they're crystal clear, "Customer_Last_Name", and sometimes they're not, "CUST_LNM".  The question you have to ask yourself is really how lucky do you feel?  If it's an acronym (CLN) that's tossed around by you, your team, your customers, your clients and possibly your grandfather, then by all means, go with the flow. That's a lot to ask of luck and your grandfather.  Have a heart!  Part of fixing data is sometimes just giving it a reasonably graspable, readable and brief name.  Hard but doable.  Shoot for one word instead of two, two instead of three, anymore and you're really talking way too much in a column name.  Remember: it's a handle for your brain to hang on.  

* Of the data, part 2 - table names group a measureable condition about something that's important.  

* Of the data, part 3 - database names.  It's the whole enchilada here.  Sour cream, filling, lettuce, cheese, the works.
