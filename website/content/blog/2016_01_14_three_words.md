In one of the most highly cited papers in psychology, Princeton psychologist George Miller stated that in general we can handle seven plus or minus two chunks of information [wiki]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two).

I'd argue that in the case of analytics, this number is capped at five simply because most analytic operations are complex, and merging them together into a larger statement makes it really hard for the human brain to simply keep up, much less make actual decisions.

At the end of the day, all analytics drives behavior - either we're stopping, starting or continuing progress on a particular situation, and often the deepest and most suprising wins are found when you are combining multiple sources of data into one stream of information.  

Since we're wired to handle a limited number of concepts, I'd put the actual limit of verbs in an analytic sentence at three, and the rest (4 +/- 2) are labels and criteria.

As an example, my goal is to make sense of bike rental patterns.  I have rental locations, bike types, dates and simple daily volume.  At this point I have four discrete pieces of information to work with, and as soon as you start working through the problem, you hit the seven cap very quickly.
