Whenever you buy a new product wrapped in packaging, your first step is to look for the seam.  If it's an Apple product, it'll probably have a somewhat obvious and very easy to use "start here" tab, and everything else comes out from there.

As you start thinking about analytic problems, the first step is to start looking for those seams that define the shapes of the data.  Some of those will have that "start here" tab almost up front - simple names that group things together - Active/Inactive, Male/Female, Democrat/Republican/Independent, Red/Yellow/Blue/Green.  Each of those gives you a quick way to dive into the shape of the data and that ability to move quickly between layers is a critical ability for every analytic tool.  Most visual analytic tools give you those handles for free - double click and go deep. 

Whatever tool you're using, get fast at switching between layers of granularity.  The quicker you can go between the overall 10,000 foot level and the ground level inspection, the more likely your overloaded brain will be able to hold on to the new insights popping out right and left.  If you go too slow (1+ seconds), it's too easy to go, "Uhhh, what was I thinking of?"

With each group should come a metric - at the very least a simple count of records.  How many times did we sell Apples?  Want a little more flourish?  Add another metric and you're well on your way to getting a much deeper and more complex grasp of the overall picture and you'll be able to share the results much more quickly
