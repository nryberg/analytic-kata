At the end of the day, or at the very least, the end of this analytic, you have two stories to tell -

  __#1 - Content__

  The impact of the analysis - what it is you're trying to get your audience to understand.

  __#2 - Process__

  How did you walk the path to success?  Someone else, maybe the future you, will wonder how you got there.
