The direction of your analytics can go in one of two directions, and oddly simultaneously in some circumstances.

## Explore

You're taking it in - you're trying to learn about a system, what the data is shaped like.

## Explain

You're giving it out - you're trying to get someone _else_ to understand what the system is about and what the possibilities could be.
