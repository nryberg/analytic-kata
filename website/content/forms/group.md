Your data is a given, but underneath the covers are patterns of groups and
statistical insights.  

We as humans pigeonhole.  It's our superpower.  We group this batch of items
together with that attribute and it's how we can even make sense of the larger
patterns of life.  These groups are typically text or date, but can include
numeric labels.
