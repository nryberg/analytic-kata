### It has to be personal
Whatever you're up to, at the end of the day it has to connect in some way shape or form with whatever it is that motivates you out of bed in the morning.  If you're a banker, and you're learning profit margins on fruit, you'd better be a commercial banker who deals primarily with the grocer industry, or perhaps farmers.  If you're a grocer, and you're learning interest rate calculations, then it only makes sense that these would be for loans for new stores or delivery trucks.

If you're that banker who deals with home mortgages, learning about fruit sales not only is counter productive, it gets in the way of the underlying goal - learn how to put numbers and facts together in new and interesting ways.  

Your brain has to be unlocked to the potential in the data crossing your desk every day, and the key has to be shaped to that data.  Fortunately, at the heart of analytics, every key and lock combination basically works the same.  We're simply need to add different colors, maybe metals, and complexity.
