Joining data is (depending on your choice of analytic tool) either as easy as falling off a log or just short of heart surgery.  The best tools make it easy and intuitive, almost guiding you down the path to success.  The worst ask for you ID and social security at every turn.

The join is one of the level up skills for an analyst.  If you can join a set a facts (sales, races, weather) with a set of lookup tables (location, racers, location) your options for in depth analysis have just quadrupled.  If you have two related sets of facts - sales dollars and sales volumes - your capacity to drive insight has just blossomed.  

Master this skill, and all kinds of good things will start to happen for you.
