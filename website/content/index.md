In our lives, data has gone from something jealously guarded by the IT gurus and doled out on a strictly need to know basis.  There was a huge gap between the technicians who spoke abstract languages like COBOL and could navigate the complicated "green screen" terminals, and the true owners of the data. The people who knew __what__ the data meant couldn't touch it, make sense of it and generate the change that has to happen.

Using simple techniques, practicing regularly against sample data, you can develop the skills to gather, crunch and develop a story that will change your view of your own world, and most importantly give you the knowledge to confidently change other people's view of your world.  

Dive in, pick a tool, grab data that makes sense to you, and follow the kata to build the muscle and mental skills you can use to drive change.
