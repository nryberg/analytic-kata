Every analysis has a little Mount Everest inside.  A challenge that sounds insurmountable, perhaps even a little deadly.  But remember, the view is amazing.  And I will be your [Tenzeng Norgay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenzing_Norgay).

The goals can be lofty - understand why we're only selling our product to 10 year old girls on the west side of Phoenix, AZ.  Find out how we can connect with Mom-n-Pop convenience stores in the Bronx.  

Sometimes, they're a little mundane - total up the points in a game and do an average of all the games - I want to know how kick-ass my little league team really is.

In every case, the steps are pretty simple and repeatable.  There just may be a few more to get over that digital mountain and cross the icy data crevasse.  But I guarantee, you'll be tickled with the results.  

More often than not, you'll end up at a goal with conclusions and surprises you simply couldn't have imagined without digging deep into the data.  You'll come away with an appreciation for sunsets on the mountain range of information that will change how you think about whatever it is that you're trying to understand, do better and make the world a better place.

So - can you cross the Alps with a bag of chips, a can of diet coke and a little moxie?  

__Yes__. The moxie will have to be unbelievable and you'll have to be able to sleep _in_ the bag of chips, but with this road map in hand, you'll have the legs of giants and will cross the finish line with the the results firmly clenched in your teeth.  

_After_ you drink the diet coke.
