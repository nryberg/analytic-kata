Analytic Kata
=============

The Analtyic Kata are a series of exercises built on the martial arts concept of
a system of short routines that can be coupled together into a program that a
student can learn from and demonstrate mastery of the art.  In this case, we're
kicking bits and bytes, and chopping rows of data, but the idea of continually
improving is the same. 

Mastery of Technique
---

The physical repetition of a kata slightly varies each time.  Hopefully over
time it comes closer and closer to perfection.  Senior masters will provide
correction, and the student will build new muscle memory around the techniques. 

Ultimately, the kata will generate a new set of challenges based on the same
techniques.  Data will be gathered, joined, condensed and shared.  However since
the practice of the kata will be (typically) solo, this system will provide a
mechanism to add some variety to the actual data.  This will force the student
to get the technique correct and know that they're on the mark without simply
repeating a pattern thoughtlessly. 

Learning by Teaching 
---

Every black belt, whether in Judo, Aikido or R, has ingrained the technique to a
point where they literally cannot express in words what they're doing.  It's
vitally critical to the continued development of the master and the field of
potential new masters that they train the lower classes on a regular basis.
Besides ensuring the survival of the technique for future generations, it keeps
surfacing the content in new and more complete ways in the master's brain.

These kata are designed to provide a foundation for masters to quickly pass on
new techniques to novices and take advantage of the virtuous cycle of mastery
through teaching.

Your Moves
---

Most martial arts disciplines have a variety of basic moves using parts of the body in
combinations.  Analytics has a similar vocabulary of moves that are built
together into combinations.

Every set of kata will have at least three levels of difficulty.  The simple
should be a nice starting point, and the expert levels ideally fiendish.

### Basic Motion

Getting data from point A to B is a critical and basic to every analytic
process.  

#### Gather

This is no different than "wipe on, wipe off".  The youngest novice to the
craggiest 6 degree black belt has to acquire data from somewhere. 

#### Move

Without qualification or modification, sometimes you simply need to migrate your
data from one location to another.  Clean and simple.  

#### Share

You were taught to share at a young age, team building encourages sharing.  Why
should this be any different?  The formats are often simple - Excel thrives at
this point, with PDF's shortly behind.  Getting the data to a useful and
accessible location can be a little tricky.

### Joins

One of these things is not like another.  Or is it?

Choice of Analytic Tools
===

Within the world of every major martial art form is hundreds of variations.  Two
Aikido dojos miles apart in the same major metropolitan area will teach differently and
value different schools of thought.  Both are valid and will provide both
physical benefit and safety. (Both will also be slightly dismissive of the
other, but that's human nature)

How you exercise your kata is dependent on what tools you have at hand.  Perhaps
you're a corporate SAS or Tableau user, maybe you're a data scientist exercising
R and Python, and maybe you're an Excel spreadsheet black belt.  Each tool is
valid and will provide analytic benefit, though they vary dramatically in their
cost and speed to analysis results.

With a little adaptation, you should be able to perform almost all of the kata
within one tool environment.  Remember, limitations will set you free.
