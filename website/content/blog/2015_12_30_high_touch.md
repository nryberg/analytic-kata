One of the most intangible yet most important metrics is the ability to handle your data, inspect it and understand how it all fits together.  Really great analytic tools go out of their way to make your tables, rows, columns something you can work with, view and quickly understand.  The very worst sorts of tools (usually the legacy, older generation) expect you to hold a mental or perhaps paper model of the data.  While it's great to get physical, it's infuriating that it should be a requirement.

Analytics is all about change - moving data into your process, mixing it with other sources, selecting what's important, adding filters, subtracting columns, charting results.  Very rarely what goes in is what comes out.  But if you don't know what it looked like to start with and aren't really sure what's happening in the middle, then the whole process is error prone and probably just annoying.
