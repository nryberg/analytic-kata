The Analtyic Kata are a series of exercises built on the martial arts concept of a system of short routines that can be coupled together into a program that a student can learn from and demonstrate mastery of the art.  In this case, we're kicking bits and bytes, and chopping rows of data, but the idea of continually improving is the same.

While this is hosted in Github for convenience, it's a system that can be ported to almost any learning and analytic environment.  Individual dialects (R, Python, Tableau, Alteryx, SAS, etc...) will be constructed for each set of kata.

Mastery of Technique
----

The physical repetition of a kata slightly varies each time.  Hopefully over time it comes closer and closer to perfection.  Senior masters will provide correction, and the student will build new muscle memory around the techniques.

Ultimately, the kata will generate a new set of challenges based on the same techniques.  Data will be gathered, joined, condensed and shared.  However since the practice of the kata will be (typically) solo, this system will provide a mechanism to add some variety to the actual data.  This will force the student to get the technique correct and know that they're on the mark without simply repeating a pattern thoughtlessly.

Learning by Teaching
---

Every black belt, whether in Judo, Aikido or R, has ingrained the technique to a point where they literally cannot express in words what they're doing.  It's vitally critical to the continued development of the master and the field of potential new masters that they train the lower classes on a regular basis.  Besides ensuring the survival of the technique for future generations, it keeps surfacing the content in new and more complete ways in the master's brain.

These kata are designed to provide a foundation for masters to quickly pass on new techniques to novices and take advantage of the virtuous cycle of mastery through teaching.

Forms
---

Most martial arts disciplines have a variety of basic moves using parts of the body in combinations.  Analytics has a similar vocabulary of moves that are built together into combinations.

Every set of kata will have at least three levels of difficulty.  The simple should be a nice starting point, and the expert levels ideally fiendish.

The major forms are:

### [Get](/forms/get/)  - Gather the data and prep it for analysis
### [Mix](/forms/mix/) - join datasets into a more comprehensive picture
### [Fix](/forms/fix/) - apply formulas and clean up data
### [Pick](/forms/pick/) - choose wisely and succeed, choose poorly and weep
### [Group](/forms/group/) - group similar things together, understand the deeper visual and statistic patterns
### [Measure](/forms/measure/) - Metrics give shape, paint that shape on the page
### [Chart](/forms/chart/) - bring the data to life on the screen
### [Share](/forms/share/) - Give back to your audience, friends and neighbors
