Choose your friends and columns wisely, for they will help determine if you will
successfully finish your analytic on time, under budget and with great results.

While every dataset can be enhanced with joined data, almost every dataset has
too much to say. Pare and prune the data to just the columns you need and be
confident you can always add back what was removed.

Inch by inch, row by row, the complement to selection is choosing what to focus
on.  One billion rows can encompass the world of your analytics, but at its
heart what really matters is just a few thousand rows of critical information.
