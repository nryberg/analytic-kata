One of these things is not like another.  Or is it?

#### Matched Joins

The simplest of concepts - a one to one match.  Things get a little more
complicated with many-to-one and one-to-many, but this is basic relationships.

#### Unmatched Joins

You had a great dinner but made a little too much and now it's sitting in the
fridge.  These are leftovers and can be just as delicious the next day for
lunch.

Not every dataset matches every other dataset, and the leftovers can be just as
interesting or more so than the original.

Think left/right outer joins.  

#### Cartesian Joins

Rarely but significantly it makes sense to join every possible match of one
dataset to every possible match of another dataset.  While this can generate
massive amounts of data, it can also open up insights otherwise impossible to
uncover.
