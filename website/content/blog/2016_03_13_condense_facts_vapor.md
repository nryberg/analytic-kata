Neal Stephenson's _Snow Crash_

Our facts our coded into databases, various facts are listed in some order, semi-cronological.  Later we gather them, crunch, and mix them ice cream shake style hoping that something sweet will come out.  

The analytic kata are about that process - the steps you take - but also about the higher question, "What's really going on here?"
